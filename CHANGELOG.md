# BACKLOG/ISSUES #
This is a list of features currently lacking and (eventually) under development:

* security groups are still broken, appear to be broken in Fog. Add `-G` support for security groups other than 'default'
* purge only works when names match up with clients
* `knife openstack floating list|associate|disassociate ip|node`
* take either the flavor ID or the flavor name
* take either the image ID or the image name
* more information in `knife openstack image list`
* get DNS names working
* availability zones
* filter out the *-initrd and *-kernel from 'openstack image list'. Fog -> container_format={aki|ari} or disk_format on the same params
* assumption of only single floating IP (and fog uses the last as the public_ip_address)
* probably other places public network is assumed that could cause issues
